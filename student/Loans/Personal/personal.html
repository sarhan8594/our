            <div >Personal loans have fixed annual percentage rates, generally from 6% to 36%. The loan with the lowest rate is the least expensive — and usually the best choice. Other features, including no fees, soft credit checks and direct payments to creditors if you’re consolidating debt, set some loans apart.

              <!-- There are many banks that offer student accounts with different benefits such as no fees, online and mobile banking options, ample ATM access, and more. Some banks also offer credit lines for students. Here are some banks that offer student accounts.A student bank account is a checking, savings, or other financial account that typically offers low fees and convenience features geared toward students. Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions offer these student-specific accounts to both high school and college students. Some accounts are available to younger students, as well.<br>

              Student bank accounts should provide student-friendly features like no fees, online and mobile banking options, ample ATM access, and more. Some may also offer student financial education, access to financial coaches, or online webinars. Generally, the best student bank accounts make it easy to sign up, deposit funds, and manage your account from anywhere. Read on for our selections of the best banks for students.
              <br>Students under 18 years of age need a parent or guardian to register as an account co-owner. Most banks allow parents to open an account for their students online. If you prefer an in-person experience, make sure that the bank you're considering has a local branch near you.
<br>
              To open a student bank account, students will typically need to provide a photo ID such as a passport or driver’s license and their Social Security number. For some accounts, students may also need to present their school ID as proof of enrollment as a student.
              
              While some banks don’t require a deposit to open an account, others require a minimum deposit amount. Deposits can be made by online transfer, by check, or with cash (in person at a branch).
              <br>
              Once the account is opened, students can create an online username and password for online access via the web or a mobile app. Students are encouraged to download the bank’s mobile app, as features like mobile deposit may only be available via the app. Debit cards typically are mailed to the student. They will need to be activated once received.

<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Debit/Credit Cards: Federal Bank offers special debit/credit cards for students with features such as cashback, discounts, and other offers.</li>
  <li>Loan Amount: The loan amount varies depending on the course and the institute you have applied for. Typically, banks offer loans up to Rs. 10 lakhs for studies in India and up to Rs. 20 lakhs for studies abroad. However, some banks may offer higher amounts based on the applicant's profile and the course selected.</li>

<li>
  Interest Rate: The interest rate on student loans is usually lower than the regular personal loans. It ranges between 8.50% to 12.50%, depending on the bank, the loan amount, and the repayment period.
</li>

<li>Repayment: The repayment period for student loans is usually between 5 to 7 years, but it may vary depending on the bank's policies. Some banks may also offer a moratorium period where you don't have to pay the loan EMI until the course completion or a few months after getting a job.</li>
<li>Interest Calculation: The interest on a student loan is calculated based on the outstanding loan amount and the interest rate. The interest is typically calculated on a daily or monthly reducing balance, which means that the interest is charged only on the outstanding principal amount and not on the entire loan amount.
